  Hello, world! My name is PJ Witkowski, and I'm a self-taught programmer currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is my first ever forray into computer science, and I'm immensely grateful for the rich resources available to me- including Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, and the thousands of tutorials on YouTube.

  I'll be using this repo to store all my practice materials and projects, and hopefully as time goes on I'll also
figure out how to effectively use Github! But I believe that the most important component of all endeavors is a strong foundation, and so the majority of my focus remains on HTML for the time being.

Until next time!

  Hello, Earth! I have begun learning CSS. It's very exciting to start to make websites that don't look terrible haha. Maybe it's just because I haven't learned any of the really complicated stuff, but programming is just kind of relaxing at the moment. It's problem solving but also after a few minutes of work you look up and there's something that wasn't there before. Creation. Magic!

  What's up, Gaia! Box Model is still kind of scary and it's made me anxious to work on anything. The novelty of learning programming has worn off a bit, and now comes the vital and hard part of the learning process. Codifying (pun intended) this effort into routine! It's hard learning this all by myself with no physical peers or teachers, but I can do hard things. I am unstoppable!
