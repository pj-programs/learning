Hello, world! My name is PJ Witkowski, and I'm a self-taught programmer currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is my first ever forray into computer science, and I'm immensely grateful for the rich resources available to me- including Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, or the thousands of tutorials on YouTube.

  I'll be using this repo to store all my practice materials and projects, and hopefully as time goes on I'll also
figure out how to effectively use Github! But I believe that the most important component of all endeavors is a strong foundation, and so the majority of my focus remains on HTML for the time being.

Until next time!

~PJ
