Hello, world! My name is PJ Witkowski, and I'm a self-taught programmer currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is my first ever forray into computer science, and I'm immensely grateful for the rich resources available to me  
for free- whether that be Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, or the thousands of tutorials on YouTube.
  I'll be using this repo to store all my practice materials and projects, and hopefully as time goes on I'll also
figure out how to effectively use Github! It's all still a little foreign to me, but I'm ready to sit down and learn.

Until next time!
~PJ
