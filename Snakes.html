        <h2>Snake Locomotion</h2>
        <p>Snakes use at least five unique modes of terrestrial locomotion.
            The kind of locomotion a snake uses in any particular instance depends on several
            factors such as the kind of surface it is crawling on and its speed.
            In fact, an individual snake can use most or all of the five modes,
            and can even use two modes in different parts of the body.
            Below are descriptions of the various modes of snake locomotion and a brief bibliography.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="loco">
        <h3>Lateral Undulation</h3>
        <p>Lateral undulation is the common serpentine locomotion of snakes. In lateral undulation, as in simple
            undulation, waves of lateral bending are propagated along the body from head to tail. But lateral undulation
            is unique in that whenever a bend contacts a surface object, such as a rock or stick, it exerts force
            against it and deforms locally around it. Whenever a snake pushes against multiple objects simultaneously,
            the lateral force vectors cancel each other, leaving a resultant vector that propels the snake forward;
            postural adjustment around each object gives the snake even finer control over the direction of force
            exertion. Force exertion against each object is inversely proportional to the number of objects being pushed
            against simultaneously by the snake, but total force is roughly constant for a given speed and substrate. In
            lateral undulation, the large dorsal muscles are activated sequentially along the body. The muscles are
            active unilaterally in each bend, from the convex part of a bend forward to the straight or concave part of
            the bend. As the snake progresses, each point along its body follows along the path established by the head
            and neck, like the cars of a train following the engine as it moves along the track (although the propulsive
            mechanism is very different); thus, sliding friction is a critical component of lateral undulation. The
            local adjustment of curvature around each point of contact with an external object indicates a high degree
            of sensory-motor control, unique to snakes and a few species of limbless lizards.</p>

        <h3>Sidewinding</h3>
        <p>Sidewinding is used by many snakes crawling on smooth or slippery surfaces, but is best known in the
            sidewinder rattlesnake (Crotalus cerastes) and a few desert vipers of Africa and Asia. Sidewinding is
            similar to lateral undulation in the pattern of bending, but differs in three critical ways: First, each
            point along the body is sequentially placed in static (rather than sliding) friction with the substrate.
            Second, segments of the body are lifted off the ground between the regions in static contact with the
            ground. Thus, the body sort of rolls along the ground from neck to tail, forming a characteristic track
            (that is proportional to body length) in sand; after being lifted off the ground and set down again a short
            distance away, the front part of the body begins a new track while the rear part of the body completes the
            old track. Third, because of the static contact and lifting of the body, the snake travels roughly
            diagonally relative to the tracks it forms on the ground. Muscle activity during sidewinding is similar to
            that in lateral undulation except that some muscles are also active bilaterally in the regions of trunk
            lifting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="loco">
        <h3>Concertina</h3>
        <p>Concertina locomotion involves alternately pulling up the body into bends and then straightening out the body
            forward from the bends. The front part of the body then comes to rest on the surface and the back part of
            the body is pulled up into bends again, and so forth. The bends may push laterally against the sides of a
            tunnel or vertically against the ground to keep the body from slipping. Thus, static friction is critical to
            concertina locomotion. Concertina locomotion is used in crawling through tunnels or narrow passages and in
            climbing. In concertina locomotion, blocks of muscles are activated simultaneously, and unilaterally, in
            regions of bending and of static contact with the sides of a tunnel.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="loco">
        <h3>Rectilinear</h3>
        <p>Rectilinear locomotion is movement in a straight line. It is used mainly by large snakes such as large
            vipers, boas, and pythons. In rectilinear locomotion, the belly scales are alternately lifted slightly from
            the ground and pulled forward, and then pulled downward and backward. But because the scales "stick" against
            the ground, the body is actually pulled forward over them. Once the body has moved far enough forward to
            stretch the scales, the cycle repeats. This cycle occurs simultaneously at several points along the body.
            Static friction is the dominant type of friction involved in rectilinear locomotion. Unlike lateral
            undulation and sidewinding, which involve unilateral muscle activity that alternates from one side of the
            body to the other, rectilinear locomotion involves bilateral activity of the muscles that connect the skin
            to the skeleton. One set of these muscles lifts the belly scales up and pulls them forward and another set
            of muscles pulls the them downward and backward.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="loco">
        <h3>Slide-Pushing</h3>
        <p>Slide-pushing involves vigorous undulations of the body that slide widely over the surface. Slide-pushing is
            used when a snake on a smooth surface is startled and tries to escape quickly, but slips over the surface.
            In slide-pushing, irregular bends of the body and tail press vertically on the surface at different points;
            although the body slips on the surface, it pushes down with enough force to move the center of mass in a
            quasi-regular, often step-like, pattern. Thus the snake progresses irregularly by slipping along the ground.
            Sliding friction is most important in slide-pushing, although there may be occasional moments of static
            contact. The patterns of muscle activity during slide-pushing are unknown.</p>
